# RepoFactory
Tired of writing boiler plate code for implementing a standard repository pattern? Here is a flexible solution :-)


# Usage
Add the JitPack repository in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:
```
allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```
Add the dependency
```
dependencies {
	        compile 'com.github.guidovezzoni:repofactory:0.1.0_alpha'
	}
```
